         at the University of Amsterdam. This was a joint project between \
         the UvA and the City of Amsterdam. The aim of the project is to create a proof-of-concept\
        of an application that incorporates the Citys ambition to use data-driven solutions to \
        increase the citys livability. PLACE does this by mimicking the City of Amsterdams \
        existing prediction model for crowdedness based on CMSA passenger data and improving it.' )
